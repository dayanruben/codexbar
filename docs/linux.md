# Linux desktop

The Linux desktop is a lightweight Qt shell over the shared CodexBar CLI. See the
[Linux guide](https://github.com/steipete/CodexBar/blob/main/Integrations/Linux/README.md) for installation, settings, the local
socket interface, and isolated runtime tests.

Ordinary launch and `codexbar-linux --usage` open Usage & Spend. Open the compact
window explicitly with `codexbar-linux --quick-view` or the tray's Quick View
item. **Use compact Quick View from the tray** is off by default; enabling it
changes the tray's primary activation only.

Quick View reuses the existing usage and spending models. It adds no provider
polling or cost scans on open. Optional spending is cached, labeled across
accounts, and accompanied by refresh errors and history-coverage caveats. Open
Spending to load local history or refresh its totals. Provider fetching and
authentication stay in the CLI.
